👋 Hi, I’m @renankarl.
👀 I’m interested in changing my career to the Computer Science field. I will be completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Estacio in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil by the end of 2023. However, I am currently residing in Portugal.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Java, SQL Advanced Searches, and working towards obtaining the Azure AZ-900 certification.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project. I am eager to contribute and be helpful.
📫 How to reach me: You can reach me at renanfkarl@gmail.com.
